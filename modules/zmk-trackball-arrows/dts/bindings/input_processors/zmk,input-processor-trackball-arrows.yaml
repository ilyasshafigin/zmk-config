  Trackball to Arrow Keys Input Processor

  This input processor transforms trackball movements (relative X/Y input events)
  into arrow key presses.

  Example usage in keymap:
  ```
  &trackball_arrows {
      threshold = <5>;
      deadzone-x = <2>;
      deadzone-y = <2>;
  };
  
  &trackball_listener {
      input-processors = <&trackball_arrows>;
  };
  ```

compatible: "zmk,input-processor-trackball-arrows"

include: ip_zero_param.yaml

properties:
  threshold:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: |
      Minimum movement distance in pixels to trigger arrow key press.
      Smaller values = more sensitive, larger values = less sensitive.
      Recommended range: 3-10 pixels.

  deadzone-x:
    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      Horizontal deadzone threshold to filter noise from sensor.
      Movements smaller than this are ignored (in pixels).

  deadzone-y:
    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      Vertical deadzone threshold to filter noise from sensor.
      Movements smaller than this are ignored (in pixels).

  bindings:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
