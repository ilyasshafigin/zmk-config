  Trackball to Arrow Keys Input Processor

  This input processor transforms trackball movements (relative X/Y input events)
  into arrow key presses. It supports two modes of operation:

  - Discrete: Each movement beyond threshold generates a single key press
  - Continuous: Keys are held while movement continues

  Example usage in keymap:
  ```
  &trackball_arrows {
      threshold = <5>;
      mode = "discrete";
      deadzone-x = <2>;
      deadzone-y = <2>;
  };
  
  &trackball_listener {
      input-processors = <&trackball_arrows>;
  };
  ```

compatible: "zmk,input-processor-trackball-arrows"

properties:
  threshold:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: |
      Minimum movement distance in pixels to trigger arrow key press.
      Smaller values = more sensitive, larger values = less sensitive.
      Recommended range: 3-10 pixels.

  mode:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "discrete"
      - "continuous"
    default: "discrete"
    description: |
      discrete: Each movement generates a single key press/release
      continuous: Keys are held while movement continues

  deadzone-x:
    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      Horizontal deadzone threshold to filter noise from sensor.
      Movements smaller than this are ignored (in pixels).

  deadzone-y:
    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      Vertical deadzone threshold to filter noise from sensor.
      Movements smaller than this are ignored (in pixels).

  track-remainders:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Track and accumulate fractional pixel remainders between events.
      Improves accuracy for slow movements by not losing sub-pixel motion.
